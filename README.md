Basic Legend of Zelda Trivia!

This is a basic trivia game which gives you a timer of 2 minutes (120 sesconds) to test your wits.
Once you either submit your answer, or time runs out, you will be taken to a screen which records your correct answers versus your incorrect answers, along with an option to try again.

Possible improvements:
1) Instead of hardcoding questions, it'd be better to code the questions/answers as objects so it would be easier to manipulate the website & likely cut down on how many lines of code there are. Also, adding question & answer randomization would be a good addition. This would probably require rewriting a decent amount of code. I would've liked to have done this however Bill Hader has a new show on HBO and I binge watched it this week.
2) Make the CSS less terrible.
